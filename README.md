# 7seals - ORACLE - 7oracle.github.io

The ORACLE is a JavaScript random word/verse generator that uses true random number generation to select words from an array.

It pulls its true random numbers from RANDOM.ORG, which uses atmospheric noise as a means to generate them.

Godshout uses a set vocabulary of over 10,000 words + phrases. Godverse pulls from every verse of the KJV Bible.

The ORACLE is inspired by TempleOS creator, Terry Davis' three Godspeak word generators, and even uses all known vocabularies from them.

Godshout's vocabularies include: GodWordsHappy, GodWords1000, VOCAB.DD, as well as a massive list of words I've added myself.

This site is mostly for HTML, CSS, and JS practice.

A work in progress, and most likely will be indefinitely. All graphics are placeholder and are subject to change.
